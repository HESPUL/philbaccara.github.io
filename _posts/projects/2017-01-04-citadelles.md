# Presentation

Classic card games created by Bruno Faidutti. "Citadelles" is a simple and effective game where each player will have to build his city to win against opponents who will do anything to prevent it.

# Concept

Haaaaa ... "Citadelles" \*sigh\* ... What good memories! A game of cards with simple rules and infinite strategies. When asked what game I prefer to do in the evening, I answer without hesitating "Citadelles" because, like a "Loup Garou de Thierceleux", this game allows to immediately install a good atmosphere around a table with friends or new acquaintances. If foul plays are the rule and the most sly strategies rewarded, this game has the main advantage of allowing all characters to be able to express themselves and have their chance.

Some time ago I had the opportunity to develop a first prototype to learn the Ruby language and the Qt framework. After many games with my friends and the evolution of technologies, the desire took me this last year to take back my prototype to bring it on smartphone using the current technologies such as React Native.

The development of the game will be done in two stages:

- <u>First step</u> : development of local game. It will take the smartphone from hand to hand to play each one in turn at the call of his character.
- <u>Second step</u> : development of the online mode where it will be possible to play online against opponents of the whole world... or not...
