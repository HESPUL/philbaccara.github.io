# Presentation

JamSession is a website which allow all musicians to post a jam session or to join one.

<p class="notice--info">
  It's the first brick of a set of tools to come dedicated to the crafts of the Arts!
</p>

# Concept

I started from a simple observation : meet musicians the instrument at hand and to be able to share with them a musical moment is rare thing except to have one of the last bar with an open stage still living in his city...

In this sense, it seemed appropriate to propose a tool allowing anyone who wants to play music and having the desire to share a musical moment with other musicians to be able to propose or join a "jam session". Whether at the corner of an alley, in the square of the city center, in a bar with a stage, in a studio, your garage, the neighbor's cellar, a cave ... whatever! Anyone with a place to perform a "jam" can submit it on JamSession.

  Detailed informations on the development of the site will be published once it's posted online !
