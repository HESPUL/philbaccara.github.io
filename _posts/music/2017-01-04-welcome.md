Hi to you humble reader and welcome on this introductory note to my blog dedicated to Music. *Why I put a big "M"? Because it's well worth it!* I started my working life as a web developer but following an opportunity in music, I threw myself in it for seven years when I devoted the most of my time and lived the best, like the worst ...

Even though today I return to my developer activity, because life is what it is, I still devote a good part of my time to music and my guitars.

<p class="notice--info">
  A small autoprod' should make its appearance in the year if everything goes well.

You can find on my blog my tastes, my discoveries, my tricks, my gules, etc. In short! Anything that will interest me in the world of Music and that makes me want to share it with you. So, I tell you very quickly for my first "real" ticket and wish you the best for this new year 2017 !
